            <h2>John John Florence</h2>
            <p>
            Considered by many to be the <span>best surfer in the world</span>, John John
            Florence seemed destined for this sport. Born and raised in <span>Hawaii</span>,
            he grew up in a house facing <span>Banzai Pipeline</span>, a world-renowned
            break famous for its <span>large waves</span> and perfect barrels. His mother
            is also a surfer, so John John first got on a board at just <span>six months
            old</span> and was already surfing on his own <span>by age five</span>. He has won <span>two
            world titles</span> in the <span>World Surf League (WSL)</span> and remains one of the
            <span>most inspiring surfers</span> for the next generation.

            <h2>Carissa Moore</h2>
            <p>
            <span>Four-time (and current) world champion</span>, Carissa Moore has reached
            the podium in <span>9 of the last 10 years</span>. But her achievement goes
            beyond that. Carissa Moore has had to compete in an <span>exceptionally
            challenging era</span>, facing off against top Australians Tyler Wright and
            Stephanie Gilmore. In fact, Moore, Wright, and Gilmore have been
            sharing the world titles <span>since 2007</span>! In addition to being one of the
            <span>best surfers</span> globally, Moore is also among the most influential, having
            been named <span>“Adventurer of the Yearˮ</span> by National Geographic,
            <span>“Woman of the Yearˮ</span> by Glamour, and repeatedly recognized as
            <span>“Top Female Surferˮ</span> in Surfer's poll.

            <h2>Gabriel Medina</h2>
            <p>
            Gabriel Medina is considered by many to be the <span>most popular
            surfer on the Championship Tour</span>. Hailing from <span>Brazil</span>, he is one
            of the driving forces behind the <span>“Brazilian Stormˮ</span> that has shaken
            up the <span>international surf scene</span>, making Brazil the only country
            able to challenge the stronghold traditionally held by Australia and
            the United States. In his home country, he is already a <span>living legend</span>
            of the sport, especially after <span>2018</span>, when he won his <span>second world
            title</span> in the <span>WSL</span> and his <span>first Pipe Masters</span>.

            <p>
            Caroline Marks is the <span>leader</span> of the <span>new generation of 21st-century
